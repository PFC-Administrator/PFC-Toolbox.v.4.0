# PFC-Toolbox.v.4.0

## Needs work:
<ol>
  <li>DataTables Server-side processing</li>
</ol>
  
## Requests / Ideas:
<ol>
  <li>Include report totals in exports.</li>
  <li>New Vendor request forms.</li>
  <li>Add multiple UPC's in Product Update forms.</li>
  <li>Add multiple amounts and subdepartments in Purchases.</li>
  <li>Request multiple shelf tags and signs in Product Update forms.</li>
  <li>Only send shelf tags to specified location, not both.</li>
  <li>Allow accounting to add new vendors themselves.</li>
  <li>Sales by description.</li>
  <li>Product information report by UPC</li>
  <li>Multi subdepartment sales reports.</li>
  <li>Allow people to request or create new Operator codes.</li>
  <li>Implementation of Co-op Deals or Bidfile?</li>
  <li>When copying from previous entry, "Category" didn't copy over and I have to re-enter it. On the same line, the Price, Cost, and re-order code should disappear for the copied entry.</li>
  <li>Only display fields with values in Product Maintenance form updates.</li>
</ol>

## Notes:
<ol>
  <li>Bookmarks to Product Maintenance circumvent the need to be logged in and create errors when trying to fill out product forms.</li>
</ol>
